## Analyzing green stocks for Steve

### Overview of Project

#### The purpose of this project is to determine if a refactored VBA script performs more quickly than the original script. In this case, we are analyzing green stock data. In addition to analyzing the performance of each script, we will also view which green stocks performed well in the year 2017 and 2018. Measuring the performance of the original and refactored VBA script to perform this analysis can show which is best to use and could be helpful in case a larger amount of stock data needs to be added to the data set and analyzed quickly.

### Results

#### Based on the execution times, the refactored script is faster than the original script. The original script for 2017 data ran in about 1.035 seconds, whereas the refactored script ran in about 0.180 seconds. For 2018, the original script ran in about 1.063 seconds and the refactored script ran in about 0.242 seconds.
